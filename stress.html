    <h3>Building Resilience</h3>
    <p>Resilience is the ability to adapt and recover when faced with a stress-causing endeavor. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is that positive childhood experiences are correlated with a high amount of resilience, and emotional support from parents can improve your resilience. National data from 2021-2023 report says “79% report they have at least one adult in their life who makes a positive difference.” A key factor in developing resilience could be having a protective factor against poor mental health outcomes, like a trusted adult or guardian. 
Resilience isn’t a fixed trait; it’s a skill worth developing and strengthening through supportive relationships and opportunities for healthy coping. The youth who possess stronger resilience skills are less likely to develop depression, anxiety, and emotional challenges.</p>
