    <h3>Why Community is Important</h3>
    <p>Mental Health America(MHA) talks about how peoples undermind the essential role of social connection in maintaining satisfactory mental health. Strong relationships with family, friends, and your local community members provide emotional support, reduce isolation, and build resilience against stress and mental illness. MHA elucidates the idea that teens who regularly connect with their community are better at coping with challenges and experience a greater sense of belonging and self-worth. Open communication and shared activities are key ways to nurture these vital connections.</p>
