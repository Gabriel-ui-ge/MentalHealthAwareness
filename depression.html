    <h3>Reset To Baseline</h3>
    <p>Due to the stresses of school, being a teen can feel overwhelming. The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry puts an emphasis on teenagers' struggles, like experiencing stress, melancholy, or having difficulties with coping. These feelings aren’t inherently wrong; it’s more of a signal from your mind and body that you have to sit down and refresh. Resetting to baseline means providing yourself with the space to relax, reaiming your focus, and rebuilding a healthy relationship with yourself. You can do activities like grounding, exercise, or deep breathing to assist in managing your stress levels. Taking breaks with intention can protect your mental health & feeling like you have more control of your life. </p>
