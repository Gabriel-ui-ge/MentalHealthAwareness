  <h2>Testimonial</h2>
  <p>  “I used to deal with a lot of peer pressure, and it always felt like I had no one to talk to about it. The website helped me understand what I was feeling and gave me real ways to handle the stress.
    Reading the advice and stories from others made me feel less alone, and it honestly helped me get back on track.” - Mohamadu Faye <br> <br><br>
  
  
  “I got bullied for having a beard at a young age, and it really messed with my confidence. When I found this website, the resources and supportive tone made me feel
    understood instead of judged. It helped me rebuild my self‑esteem and reminded me that what I look like doesn’t define my worth.” - Yazan Satariyah
