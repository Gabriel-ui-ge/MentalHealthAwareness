    <h3>You're Not Alone</h3>
    <p>How are you feeling? No, really. Before you respond with “I’m fine,” take a moment to truly express yourself. Many people keep their emotions bottled up in fear of others' opinions. But many people face these problems daily. You should know that you are not alone in your struggles. Reach out to family, friends, and those you trust for help. If you don't have people you can trust try journaling to express your thoughts. Communication is key and once you let go you will feel so much better and at ease.</p>
