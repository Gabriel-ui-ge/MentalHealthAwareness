    <h3>Balance Highs and Lows</h3>
    <p>Research from Mayo Clinic has proven that teens who perform regular physical activity tend to have improved mental health. Exercise stimulates the production of endorphins. Endorphins are a natural mood lifter in our brains. They reduce feelings of stress and anxiety. Moderate activities include walking, jogging, or playing a sport at a moderate pace. These can improve your mood, boost your self-confidence, and promote better sleep. Mayo Clinic focuses on consistent physical activity as a vital and effective way to manage stress and relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety in teenagers, supporting a life-long of improved mental well-being.</p>
