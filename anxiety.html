    <h3>About Being Under Pressure</h3>
    <p>During your teenage years, the stress of piling on assignments, scholarly expectations, and social pressures has a major impact on teenagers' stress levels. “According to the CDC, in 2023, 4 in 10 high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, and 1 in 10 attempted suicide.” This is an extremely serious issue stemming from the stresses of school. This evidence shows us how pressure is affecting students' mental health.  Poor mental health may lead to poor grades, negatively impact decision-making, and affect their health significantly. Schools can assist in relieving pressures from students by building safe & supportive communities, and schools can implement strategies that can help students' mental health and promote positive behavior.
